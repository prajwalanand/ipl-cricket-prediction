algorithm ipl:

read table of player, cluster
read table of probabilities
estimate cumulative probabilities

input : list of batsmen in order, bowlers in order

for team 1 batting, team 2 bowling:
	initialize batsman1, batsman2
	initialize probabilities of getting out
	initialize next batsman
	repeat 6 times for each bowler:
		lookup from probability table
		probability of not getting out *= (i - prob for current batsman, bowler pair)
		if probability that he will survive this ball < threshold:
			batsman is out
			if wickets = 10:
				break
			else:
				next batsman, next ball( continue )
		generate random number between 0 and 1
		runs = interval of cumulative probability
		if runs is 1, 3:
			swap batsman1, batsman2
		add total runs
	swap batsmen

repeat above for other team batting/bowling

compare total runs for each

team with higher runs is the winner
